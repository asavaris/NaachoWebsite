						1. v. int. pl. imp. (Hindi): Dance. <br/>
						2. n. Princeton's premiere Indian Dance Troupe, performing Hindi/Bollywood, Garba/Raas, Bhangra, Classical, Folk, and Fusion numbers. <br/>

						<br/>

						Naacho is devoted to the beautiful and expressive art of Indian dance. Our group seeks to promote South Asian culture through displaying a variety of traditional and contemporary Indian dance styles including: Bollywood, folk, garba/raas, bhangra, and classical forms. By performing in as many venues as possible, Naacho attempts to increase awareness of the vast and diverse cultures that originate from South Asia. In addition to dancing, we make every effort to involve ourselves with community service ranging from teaching Indian dance to donating funds to causes that benefit the South Asian community worldwide.

Hooray naacho! Nick enjoys dancing, even if he may sometimes look a fool. He also spent a year in northern India before coming to Princeton. Nick thinks the people in Naacho are awesome. He is particularly excited to dance to Batameez Dil and try and emulate Ranbir Kapoor (though he knows no one can come close to Ranbir’s suave-ness).</div>
